            <h1>Hollow Knight Silksong Review</h1>
            <p>THIS EASILY HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST GAMES OF THE CENTURY!!!</p>
            <p>
                We like to copy-paste the headline for clickbait reasons so ignore that. Anyways we got our FPS
                correspondent on this one, he's qualified trust bro
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    THIS GAME HAS A MAJOR LACK OF BATTLE PASSES, PREORDER BONUSES, FOMO SHOPS WITH PURPOSEFULLY PRICED
                    DIGITAL CURRENCY THAT LEAVES JUST BEARLY NOT BEING ABLE TO BUY THAT NEW BUNDLE YOU WANT. I NEED
                    THESE THINGS IN EVERY GAME, A GAME MADE FOR A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE (anyone but me) IS A GAME MADE
                    FOR NO ONE.

                    Yeah so as i was saying this game dosen't have any business savvy money making slop in it and a
                    distinct lack of yellow points that pop-up after I kill something so i get that hit of dopamine. I
                    also think this game needs daily challenges and login bonuses so i keep coming back day after day.
                    So yea this game is pretty bad, maybe if this game didn't expect me to do anything slightly
                    difficult then i would like it.
