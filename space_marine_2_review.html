        <h1>Space Marine 2 Review</h1>
        <p>THIS EASILY HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST GAMES OF THE CENTURY!!!</p>
        <p>
            We had our farming sim correspondent review this game and he has some real harsh stuff to say about his
            game.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                This game has a distinct lack of any agriculture, while it may have some have some heavy vehicles that
                could be converted to farming equipment and the occasional forklift - which is the backbone of any
                functional farm - this bumps the game down a considerable amount for me.
            </li>
            <li>You know I really don't know why</li>
