            <h1>Raid Shadows Legends Review</h1>
            <p>THIS EASILY HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF ALL ETERNITY!!!</p>
            <p>
                Our saudi oil prince owner decided to write this review because this one is his favorite. Hence the
                slighly diffent title.

                    This is exactly the kind of game i need for when im not busy with purchasing random companines in
                    different in ramdom industries i know nothing about, except for that they make alot of money.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This game allows me to exert the same level of financial dominance over others i have in real life.
                    I mean, i don't have to do any actual work to get the best gear and characters, just pay some money
                    for ingame currency and buy some chests that have a 1/1000000 chance to give me what i want. Then
                    the game has convient features, like the auto battle feature so i can manage newly aquired EA and
                    have some AI do all the hard work so i can come back and reap all the rewards of my investment.
                    Anyways, who plays a game so they can actually play it, it's just better having someone or something
                    else do all the hard work for you and I'm sure most people feel the same way.
